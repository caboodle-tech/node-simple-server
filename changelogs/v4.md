### NSS 4.2.0 (23 January 2024)

- feat: WebSocket connections can now specify a specific backend route instead of just sending messages to the the listener (if any) for the pages path. 

### NSS 4.1.1 (22 January 2024)

- fix: Correct a bug in the watcher where we attach a files extension to the stats object. This object is missing when moving directories causing a crash since there is no object to attach the extension, albeit non-existent, to.
- improve: Quality of life improvement by adding the Caboodle Tech Print class to replace console output; Now in color!

### NSS 4.0.0 (7 January 2024)

- !feat: Correct bug caused by NSS non-standard implementation of Chokidar; see below.

BREAKING CHANGES: NSS has always modified the standard callback parameters of Chokidar, version 4 modifies this behavior to use the standard callback parameters with the following changes:

1. Extension without the leading dot is moved into the stats or details object for events: `all`, `add`, `addDir`, `change`, and `raw`. For `unlink` and `unlinkDir` the extension is passed as an additional parameter.
2. NSS now follows the same parameters/arguments structure with the exception of the previous addition.

This will break all code that relies on NSS's old non-standard implementation of parameters/arguments in callback.
