### NSS 4.0.0 (7 January 2024)

- !feat: Correct bug caused by NSS non-standard implementation of Chokidar; see below.

BREAKING CHANGES: NSS has always modified the standard callback parameters of Chokidar, version 4 modifies this behavior to use the standard callback parameters with the following changes:

1. Extension without the leading dot is moved into the stats or details object for events: `all`, `add`, `addDir`, `change`, and `raw`. For `unlink` and `unlinkDir` the extension is passed as an additional parameter.
2. NSS now follows the same parameters/arguments structure with the exception of the previous addition.

This will break all code that relies on NSS's old non-standard implementation of parameters/arguments in callback.
