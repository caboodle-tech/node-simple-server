### NSS 3.0.1 (18 December 2023)

- chore: Correct and update README. Several settings were undocumented and new ones have been added.
- !feat: Corrected a bug where frontend websocket messages had the wrong object structure using `data` instead of `message`. Updated the websocket demo to show this correction.
- feat: Added `websocket-only.html` which will load basic websocket communications into the page and nothing else when `liveReloading` is set to `false`.
- !feat: Added the `hostAddress` option and modified `live-reloading.html` and `websocket-only.html` to work with this new option.

BREAKING CHANGES: Technically still compatible with v2 but implementations have changed.
